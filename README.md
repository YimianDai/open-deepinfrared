## SIRST-V2 Dataset

As a part of the DeepInfrared Eco-system, we provide the SIRST-V2 dataset as a benchmark.
SIRST-V2 is a dataset specially constructed for single-frame infrared small target detection, in which the images are selected from thousands of infrared sequences for different scenarios.
